## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
# 1. Download a dataset from the web. You may use any source, but specify the source in your code. Also ensure that the data has a mix of quantitative and qualitative (categorical) variables.

#https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset
```

```{r}
# 2. Import the dataset into R
Data <- Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset
```

```{r}

# 3. Print out descriptive statistics for a selection of quantitative and categorical variables.

#Descriptive Statistics for categorical variales.

categorical_variables <-c("gender","BMI Category","Sleep Disorder")

#Descriptive Statistics for quantitative variable.

numeric_variables <-c("sleep Duration","Quality of sleep","Stress Level","Daily Steps")


```

```{r}
# 4. Transform at least one variable.
# It shows sleep health and lifestyle for paticular age group affecting sleep quality.

# The data shows there are 12 people with sleep quality of 4-5 between age 28-39 showing poor quality sleep.

Data$Agegroup <- cut(
  Data$Age,
  breaks = c(25, 30, 35, 40),
  labels = c("25-29", "30-34", "35-39"),
  right = FALSE
)

table(Data$Agegroup)


```

```{r}
# 5.Plot at least one quantitative variable, and one scatterplot.

#scatter plot:
#The scatter plot depicts the age and quality of sleep.

plot(
  Data$Age,
  Data$Sleep.Duration,
  xlab = "Age",
  ylab = "Sleep Quality",
  main = "Scatter Plot of Age vs Sleep Quality",
  pch = 16
)


```

```{r}
#Histogram is used here for quantitative variable:
#The histogram shows that which age group has less hours of sleep.
hist(
  Data$Age,
  main="Histogram for quantitative variable: Person Age",
  xlab = "Age in Years",
  col = "blue",
  border = "black"
